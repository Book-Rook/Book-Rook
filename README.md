My name is Charlie Coleman, and my email address is eolhcc47@gmail.com

This is my first GitHub account, that I have made for school.

I just made my first repository named Book-Rook.github.io, and I made it for my CTI 110 class at wake tech.

I then downloaded the GitHub for Desktop app, Logged in with my GitHub account, Selected the + menu, Chose to clone a repository from the internet, and then cloned it to my GitHub folder on my C: drive.
